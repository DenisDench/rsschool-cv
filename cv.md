## Summary
I started my front-end development selfeducation not that long ago, in November 2019. But I am ambitious and super motivated. I always learn something new from online courses, books and of course by google research. Ready to hit the wall. Ready to break it and hit another.

## Skills
* Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Little experience with Sublime Text 3, VS Code, Command line

## Code examples

    ```css
        .circle {
            display: flex;
            position: absolute;
            justify-content: center;
            align-items: center;
            height: 32px;
            width: 32px;
            background-color: #8D6E63FF;
            border-radius: 18px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
    ```

## Experience
Absolutely no notable experience. Although you can visit my [google-homepage](https://github.com/DenisDench/google-homepage) repository which is my self-given challenge where I tried to copy the looks of Google homepage (just looks).
